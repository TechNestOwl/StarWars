#A Star Wars
Welcome to the Star Wars repository! This project is a showcase of proficiency in using various JavaScript array methods. Through a series of examples and implementations inspired by the Star Wars universe, this repository highlights effective use of common and advanced array operations.

##A Features
**Array Iteration:** Demonstrates the use of forEach, map, and reduce to iterate over Star Wars character data and perform calculations or transformations.

**Filtering & Searching:** Utilizes filter, find, and some to search through arrays, filter data based on specific criteria, and validate conditions.

**Sorting & Ordering:** Implements sort to organize arrays by different attributes, such as character names, species, or affiliation.

**Data Transformation:** Explores map and reduce to convert and aggregate data, such as transforming character data into a new format or calculating the total count of Jedi and Sith.
