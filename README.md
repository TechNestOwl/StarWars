Star Wars
Welcome to the Star Wars repository! This project is a showcase of proficiency in using various JavaScript array methods. Through a series of examples and implementations inspired by the Star Wars universe, this repository highlights effective use of common and advanced array operations.

Features
Array Iteration: Demonstrates the use of forEach, map, and reduce to iterate over Star Wars character data and perform calculations or transformations.

Filtering & Searching: Utilizes filter, find, and some to search through arrays, filter data based on specific criteria, and validate conditions.

Sorting & Ordering: Implements sort to organize arrays by different attributes, such as character names, species, or affiliation.

Data Transformation: Explores map and reduce to convert and aggregate data, such as transforming character data into a new format or calculating the total count of Jedi and Sith.

Chaining Methods: Showcases the power of chaining multiple array methods together for concise and powerful data processing.
